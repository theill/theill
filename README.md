### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Theill. Iâ€™m a software developer currently working as CTO of [Paralenz](https://www.paralenz.com/). Iâ€™m also a co-founder of three smaller startups: [Familio](https://familiohq.com/), [Outbound](https://outboundhq.com/) and Clientele. I started playing around with programming back in 1987 on a good old Commodore 64 and got more serious around 1994 where some of my first shareware products were released.
