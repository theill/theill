### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Peter Theill. Iâ€™m a software developer currently working as CTO of Paralenz. Iâ€™m also a co-founder of three smaller startups: Familio, Outbound and Clientele. I started playing around with programming back in 1987 on a good old Commodore 64 and got more serious around 1994 where some of my first shareware products were released.

I finished my first education as a Datamatician in 1998 and immediately joined Belle Systems as a Software Developer. It was an exciting time joining a company as employee #24 and over the next four years follow it growing into a 500+ employees company (and then down to ~200). It was the dot com days ðŸ™‚

While working at Belle Systems, a colleague and I decided to build a site for shareware authors. A couple of sites already existed but were all badly designed, had lots of advertisements and did not provide a lot of value for the software authors. We named it Filebasket and grew it quickly to 200k+ users before it was acquired by Digital River.

I decided to leave Belle Systems (now called Digiquant) in 2002 to study Computer Science. I did that while continuing doing some consultancy for Digiquant and other customers, primarily working with the .NET platform.

A cool startup called ZYB contacted me a couple of years later and I decided to join as their second backend developer. It was a great ride where I got to work with extreme talent until we got acquired by Vodafone. At that time, I decided to leave to start a company called Gazebo with a couple of colleagues.

Gazebo helped other startups build a prototype of their idea in weeks so they were able to present something for investors. A couple of companies we helped are Rojabo and Biokemi.

Even though Gazebo was quite successful we decided to throttle down after only one year of operation since we, the founders, did not agree in which direction to move the company.

I went back to consulting until I became a partner in GoMore. I rebuild the technology stack from a 8+ year old system and took it from 15k to 90+ users in 1.5 year.

In 2011 I co-founded Click A Taxi, later rebranded into Drivr. It was an amazing ride, where we pivoted a couple of times but in the end had to close down in 2017. I left with a lot of learnings.

After a couple of months thinking about what to do next, another guy and I co-founded Familio.
